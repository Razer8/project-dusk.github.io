Removed <ul> as well as the descriptions of each artwork. Reworking the gallery page to flex. Will have more opportunities to implement desc. as the website progresses.

In addition, Mr. Zits will be repurposed in the near future. Will no longer be the main logo.

Desc. Ref #1: Dusk - The drawing that depicts a blue fox wearing a gas mask was orignally a logo when I first began learnig how to do digital art via Procreate on the iPad. I go by @dusk_gallery on Instagram if you're interested seeing the rest of my work.

Desc. Ref #2: Spookintosh - I came up with a funny and yet cool idea of drawing the orignal Macintosh computer from 1984. I wanted to give it a neon vaperwave effect to it as well and made a 3D skelecton popping out of the computer's display. you can also find this on my Instagram page where the grid is animated.
