	<p>Hello and welcome! Project Dusk is where you can follow my work and see the latest projects me and some friends of mine are working on. You can follow me on my instagram page <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dusk_gallery" alt="instagram page for dusk_gallery" target="_blank"><strong>@dusk_gallery</strong></a> to see what me and my team are up to. As of right now, the website is undergoing major construction but more content is to come in the near future. For now, you can view some of my recent artwork via the gallery in the navigation section. There will be a community board too, so please be part of our community and join the project today!</p>
